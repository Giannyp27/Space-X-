## SpaceX Landing Prediction Project

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting the landing success of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets using various machine learning models. The aim is to improve the accuracy of landing predictions, which is crucial for the sustainability and cost-efficiency of space missions.

### Objective
To build a predictive model that accurately forecasts the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 landings.

### Data Collection
- **Source:** Data was collected from the official SpaceX API and supplemented with additional information from public datasets.
- **Features:** The dataset includes variables such as launch site, payload mass, orbit, launch outcome, booster version, and weather conditions.

### Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to understand the data distribution and identify key features influencing landing success.
3. **Model Selection:** Tested multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
4. **Model Training:** Used cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The SVM model achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 84.82%.

### Results
- **Best Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Accuracy:** 84.82%
- **Cross-validation Score:** Consistently high across multiple folds, demonstrating robust predictive capability.

### Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 landing outcomes using machine learning. The insights gained can help improve launch strategies and reduce mission costs.

### Future Work
- **Feature Expansion:** Incorporate more granular weather data and real-time telemetry.
- **Model Improvement:** Experiment with deep learning models for enhanced predictive accuracy.
